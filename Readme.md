# Logistic Regression Model for Classification

This project implements a **Logistic Regression** model to classify data using **scikit-learn**.  
It includes a full **ML pipeline**, model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model for future use with **joblib**.

---

## 📌 Features
- Preprocessing with **Pipeline** (scaling + model).
- Logistic Regression classifier.
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, cross-validation).
- Save and load trained model using `joblib`.
- Easily extendable for deployment (API / Web App).

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Joblib
